# MegaCorpOne-Penetration-Test-Report

This repository contains my final submission of the challenge assignment for Modules 16 &amp; 17 of Georgia Tech's Cybersecurity and Networking Bootcamp.

For this assignment, students were tasked with performing a mock penetration test against the fictional corporation known as MegaCorpOne. Over the course of two weeks, students interacted with and attempted to exploit a web applicaiton, Linux servers, Windows workstation, and a Windows Domain Controller.

Within my report, I outline the vulnerabilities discovered throughout the penetration test and provide recommended remediation techniques for MegaCorpOne given the identified successful vulnerabilities.
