# MegaCorpOne Penetration Test Report

This file is my final submission of the challenge assignment for Modules 16 &amp; 17 of Georgia Tech's Cybersecurity and Networking Bootcamp.

For this assignment, students were tasked with performing a mock penetration test against the fictional corporation known as MegaCorpOne. Over the course of two weeks, students interacted with and attempted to exploit a web applicaiton, Linux servers, Windows workstation, and a Windows Domain Controller. At the conclusion of the two weeks, students were then instructed to compose a report to be provided to the corporate management of MegaCorpOne which would act to summarize the findings of the test.

Within my report, I outline the vulnerabilities discovered throughout the penetration test and provide recommended remediation techniques for MegaCorpOne given the identified successful vulnerabilities.



# Rekall Corporation Penetration Test Report

This file is the final submission for Project 2 of Georgia Tech's Cybersecurity and Networking Bootcamp.

Students took three days to perform a full penetration test against Rekall Corporation. The engagement covered web application testing, as well as Linux and Windows end-point testing and network penetration. Instructors and TAs were not allowed to assist students for this project and all the findings presented within my report were found by me directly. I've included screenshots for each vulnerability identified, as well as provided suggested mitigation techniques for Rekall to implement moving forward. As with the previous penetration test report, the deliverable for this project is intended to act as a final report to the corporate mangement of Rekall Corporation (a fictional entity).
